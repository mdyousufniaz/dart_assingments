### 📝 Assignment: Simple Multiplication Table

**Problem Description:**

Write a Dart program that prints the multiplication table for a **single number** entered by the user. Use a loop to generate the table. (No need for nested loops yet if you want it very easy.)

**Input:**

- An integer `n` (the number for which to print the table).

**Output:**

- The multiplication table from `1 × n` to `10 × n`.

**Example:**

**Input:**

```
Enter a number: 3

```

**Output:**

```
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15
3 x 6 = 18
3 x 7 = 21
3 x 8 = 24
3 x 9 = 27
3 x 10 = 30

```

**Hints:**

- Use a **single loop** from 1 to 10.
- Multiply the user’s number by the loop counter and print the result.
